# Spotify_Search
This is a project that will let you download songs from spotify by typing in the song name.
This is something i found annoying with other downloaders which required you to go to the spotify website and copy the link, this does that for you.
This program uses spotify-dl for the actual downloading part.

Note:
currently there is no windows version and I am running into quite a few bugs with the macos version, it does work perfectly on linux though :)

To install the program download this git repo and run the installer script:

`git clone https://github.com/Laar3/Spotify_Search/`

Otherwise you will have to run the file manually (it is placed in your home folder so you can easily chuck it somewhere), run with:
