# Spotify_Search
This is a project that will let you download songs from spotify by typing in the song name.
This is something i found annoying with other downloaders which required you to go to the spotify website and copy the link, this does that for you.
This program uses spotify-dl for the actual downloading part.

# Installation


To install the program run the installer script:
`sh install.sh`

If you choose to install it properly then you can run the file with:
`spotifysearch`

Otherwise you will have to run the file manually (it is placed in your home folder so you can easily chuck it somewhere), run with:
`./spotifysearch`
while in the same directory

to configure the program edit the file in ~/.config/spotifysearch/
