# Spotify_Search
This is a project that will let you download songs from spotify by typing in the song name.
This is something i found annoying with other downloaders which required you to go to the spotify website and copy the link, this does that for you.
This program uses spotify-dl for the actual downloading part.

# Installation


To install the program run the installer script

`sh setup.sh`


to configure the program edit the file in ~/.config/spotifysearch/
